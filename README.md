# What is Sekoya?
In short, sekoya is a XML tree editor that supports "branching" (conditions). 
Its main goal is to provide a software that is easier and more "comfortable" to use than the BehaviourTreeCreator made by Ronimo Games as 
in my opinion it's missing a lot of shortcuts and options.

# How can I help?
The software is currently not finished and the code is a HUGE mess so I will gladly take any suggestion but at the moment I prefer to finish it and clean it before accepting code contributions. I will think about it in the future though.
