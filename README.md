# What is the Better AI editor

The Better AI editor (BAE) is a tool allowing you to create / edit branch logic quickly and save them as xml files.
Its original purpose is to create and edit AI for the game [Awesomenauts](https://awesomenauts.com) but I want to make this tool compatible for any other projects requiring this kind of architecture.

This tool is inspired by Ronimo's AI editor (you can find more info about it here: http://joostdevblog.blogspot.ch/2014/06/the-ai-tools-for-awesomenauts.html).

# Why is it called "Better" ?
As linked above it is inspired by Ronimo's one but I found their editor to be lacking a lot of features that could make it a lot smoother to use.

Fun fact: I requested a lot of time to be able to close a setting window using enter because you always have to move your mouse to close it (you can't even use tab!) and this may be the main reason on why I'm making a new one.

Also the acronym is BAE
